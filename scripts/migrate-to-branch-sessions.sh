# This script helps existing JFL users migrate to the new simplified session model.
# It handles:
# - Saving uncommitted work from worktrees
# - Merging session branches to main
# - Removing worktree directories
# - Cleaning up metadata files

# @purpose Migration from worktree sessions to branch-only sessions
