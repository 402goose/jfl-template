# jfl-template - Service Specification

**Type:** library (template repository)
**Status:** Stable
**Repository:** git@github.com:402goose/jfl-template.git

## Purpose

jfl-template is the starter template repository that `jfl init` clones to bootstrap new JFL GTM (Go-To-Market) workspaces. It provides the complete directory structure, configuration files, session management scripts, Claude Code hooks, skills, and knowledge document templates that every new JFL project needs.

## Core Responsibilities

- Provide a consistent, functional starting point for every new JFL project
- Include all session management infrastructure (init, cleanup, sync, auto-commit, doctor)
- Ship with Claude Code hooks (`.claude/settings.json`) pre-configured for session lifecycle
- Deliver empty-but-structured knowledge document templates (VISION, NARRATIVE, ROADMAP, THESIS, brand docs)
- Include the CRM CLI wrapper (`./crm`) for configurable CRM backends
- Bundle all JFL skills (brand-architect, content-creator, hud, startup, etc.)
- Provide the `.mcp.json` configuration for the jfl-context MCP server
- Include service-agent templates for onboarding services under a GTM workspace

## Integration Points

- **jfl CLI** (`jfl init`): Clones this repo as the starting point for new projects
- **jfl CLI** (`jfl update`): Updates CLAUDE.md, skills, and scripts from this template
- **jfl-context-hub**: MCP server configured in `.mcp.json`, started by SessionStart hook
- **jfl-services**: Session coordination API, used by session-init.sh and session-cleanup.sh
- **GitHub**: Hosted at 402goose/jfl-template, pulled via git clone

## Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16
**Current Version:** Latest commit b7dd40d
**Stability:** Stable (production use across multiple JFL projects)

## Open Questions

- How should template versioning work? Currently no tags or version numbers.
- Should skills be separated into a skills repo or remain bundled?
- How should breaking changes to CLAUDE.md be communicated to existing projects?
- Should the template support non-Claude AI agents (e.g., different CLAUDE.md equivalents)?
