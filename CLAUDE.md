# JFL - Claude Instructions

Your context layer. Any project. Any AI.

## Project Identity

**Get project name from (in order):**
1. `.jfl/config.json` → `name` field
2. `knowledge/VISION.md` → first heading
3. Directory name

Use this name in status displays, greetings, and when referring to the project.

## Philosophy

**Vision emerges from doing, not declaring.**

Don't make users fill out forms before they can build. Let them start immediately. Capture context INTO the knowledge docs as you work together - the docs become a record of decisions, not a gate to getting started.

---

## CRITICAL: Worktree Session Isolation

**Multi-session safety requires worktrees. This is non-negotiable.**

When SessionStart hook runs, it creates an isolated worktree for this session. You will see:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  CLAUDE: You MUST run: cd /path/to/worktrees/session-xxx
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### YOU MUST CD TO THAT PATH IMMEDIATELY

If you don't cd to the worktree:
- You'll work directly on `main` branch
- Multiple sessions will clobber each other
- Team members will overwrite each other's work
- **This breaks everything**

### At Session Start

1. **See the cd instruction** in hook output
2. **Run the cd command** exactly as shown
3. **Verify** you're in the worktree:
   ```bash
   pwd && git branch --show-current
   ```
   Should show `worktrees/session-*` path and `session-*` branch, NOT `main`

### If You Missed the Output

```bash
# Find the worktree path
cat .jfl/current-worktree.txt

# CD to it
cd $(cat .jfl/current-worktree.txt)

# Verify
pwd && git branch --show-current
```

### Why This Matters

Each session gets its own branch (`session-user-date-id`). Changes auto-merge to main periodically. On session end, everything merges cleanly. Without this:
- Session A edits file X
- Session B edits file X
- Both think they're on main
- Chaos ensues

**Do not skip this step. Ever.**

---

## CRITICAL: Journal Protocol

**Write the journal as you go. Don't wait for session end.**

The journal (`.jfl/journal/<session-id>.jsonl`) is the structured record of what's happening. Sessions crash, windows close, context resets — the journal survives.

### When to Write

Append a journal entry when ANY of these happen:
- **Decision made** (even small ones)
- **Knowledge doc updated** (BRAND_DECISIONS, SPEC, ROADMAP, etc.)
- **Something learned** (especially from errors/debugging)
- **Major feature completed**
- **External conversation** (CRM contact, investor, customer)

**Don't ask permission. Don't batch. Write immediately.**

### Entry Format (JSONL)

Each entry is a single JSON object on one line in `.jfl/journal/<session-id>.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "ts": "2026-01-25T10:30:00.000Z",
  "session": "session-goose-20260125-xxxx",
  "type": "feature|fix|decision|milestone|discovery",
  "status": "complete|incomplete|blocked",
  "title": "Short but descriptive title",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of what happened",
  "detail": "Full description. What was built? Files? Stubs? Next steps?",
  "files": ["file1.ts", "file2.ts"],
  "decision": "decision-slug",
  "next": "what should happen next"
}
```

**Required fields:** `v`, `ts`, `session`, `type`, `title`, `summary`
**Recommended:** `detail`, `files`, `next`

### How to Write Entries

```bash
# Get session ID from branch
SESSION=$(git branch --show-current)
JOURNAL=".jfl/journal/${SESSION}.jsonl"
mkdir -p .jfl/journal

# Append entry (single line JSON)
echo '{"v":1,"ts":"...","session":"...","type":"feature","title":"...","summary":"..."}' >> "$JOURNAL"
```

Or use the Write tool to append directly.

### Reading the Journal

Use the synopsis command for human-readable summaries:
```bash
node product/packages/memory/dist/cli.js synopsis 24        # Last 24 hours
node product/packages/memory/dist/cli.js synopsis 8 hath    # What did Hath do?
```

**Triggerable anytime.** User can say "journal this" or "write that down" and you should add an entry.

---

## CRITICAL: Immediate Decision Capture

**When a decision is made, update the relevant doc IMMEDIATELY.**

Don't ask "should I update the doc?" Don't say "I'll update that later." Just do it.

### Flow

1. Decision made in conversation
2. Identify the relevant doc:
   - Naming/brand → `knowledge/BRAND_DECISIONS.md`
   - Product direction → `product/SPEC.md` or relevant spec
   - Roadmap/timeline → `knowledge/ROADMAP.md`
   - Architecture → relevant `*_SPEC.md`
3. Update the doc immediately (use Edit tool)
4. Add journal entry
5. Continue conversation

### Example

```
User: "Let's go with Option A for the pricing"

Claude: *updates knowledge/PRICING.md*
        *adds journal entry*
        "Done — updated PRICING.md with Option A.
         Ready to implement or want to discuss the tiers?"
```

### Why This Matters

- Decisions get lost in chat history
- Docs become stale if we wait
- Future sessions need current state
- The journal tracks the narrative, docs track current truth

---

## Session Management

**Context loss is unacceptable.** The session hooks handle sync automatically.

### What Happens on Session Start

The `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json` automatically:
1. Creates an isolated worktree for this session
2. Syncs repos in the background (git pull, submodule updates)
3. Starts auto-commit (every 2 minutes)
4. Starts auto-merge to main (every 15 minutes)

**You don't need to run sync manually.** The hooks handle it.

### If Something Looks Wrong

If files appear missing or out of sync:
```bash
# Check sync status
git status
git submodule status

# Manual sync if needed
./product/scripts/session/session-sync.sh
```

### Auto-Save

The session hooks automatically:
- **Auto-commit**: Every 2 minutes (in worktree)
- **Auto-merge**: Every 15 minutes (worktree → main)
- **On Stop/PreCompact**: Final commit and push

You don't need to manage commits manually. Work is continuously saved.

---

## CRM Configuration

**CRM is config-driven.** The `./crm` CLI reads from `.jfl/config.json` and routes to the appropriate backend.

### Supported Backends

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `google-sheets` | Google Sheets via googleapis | Teams, real-time sync |
| `airtable` | Airtable via API | Rich field types, views |
| `markdown` | knowledge/CRM.md file | Solo, no external deps |

### Setup

Run the setup wizard:
```bash
./crm setup
```

This will:
1. Ask which backend you want
2. Collect required credentials/IDs
3. Save config to `.jfl/config.json`

### Config Structure

```json
// .jfl/config.json
{
  "crm": {
    "type": "google-sheets",
    "config": {
      "sheet_id": "your-sheet-id"
    }
  }
}
```

For Airtable:
```json
{
  "crm": {
    "type": "airtable",
    "config": {
      "base_id": "your-base-id",
      "api_key_env": "AIRTABLE_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

For markdown:
```json
{
  "crm": {
    "type": "markdown",
    "config": {
      "path": "knowledge/CRM.md"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variable Fallback

If CRM type is not configured but `CRM_SHEET_ID` env var is set, the CLI automatically uses Google Sheets.

### Commands

```bash
./crm                    # Dashboard (if supported by backend)
./crm list               # List deals/contacts
./crm prep <name>        # Prep for a call (full context)
./crm touch <name>       # Log activity
./crm setup              # Run setup wizard
```

Available commands depend on your CRM backend.

## Core Architecture Principle

**A GTM workspace should NEVER house product code.**

JFL creates GTM workspaces - context layers for building and launching. The actual product code always lives in its own separate repo. Even if you're a founder building everything, the structure is:

```
my-project-gtm/              ← GTM workspace (this repo)
├── product/                 ← SUBMODULE → your-product-repo
├── knowledge/               ← Strategy, vision, narrative
├── content/                 ← Marketing content
├── suggestions/             ← Contributor work
├── skills/                  ← JFL skills (updated via jfl update)
└── CLAUDE.md                ← Instructions (updated via jfl update)

your-product-repo/           ← SEPARATE REPO (all code lives here)
├── src/
├── cli/
├── platform/
└── ...
```

**Why?**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Product can be worked on independently
- GTM context doesn't pollute product repo
- Multiple GTMs can reference same product
- `jfl update` updates GTM toolkit without touching product

---

## Contributor Setup (For JFL Developers Only)

> **Note:** This section is for people contributing to the JFL project itself.
> If you're a JFL user building your own product, skip this - you installed `jfl` from npm and it just works.

If you're contributing to JFL itself, follow this setup:

### 1. Clone through a GTM (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a GTM workspace
jfl init my-jfl-gtm

# During setup, add the JFL product repo as submodule:
# - Choose "Building a product"
# - Enter: https://github.com/402goose/just-fucking-launch.git
```

### 2. Run the dev setup script

```bash
cd my-jfl-gtm/product
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install CLI dependencies
- Link `jfl` globally from this location
- Verify everything is working

### 3. Work in the submodule

All product code changes happen in `product/`:

```bash
# Make changes in product/
cd product/
# ... work on code ...

# Commit to product repo
git add . && git commit -m "feature: ..." && git push

# Update GTM's reference (optional, for tracking)
cd ..
git add product && git commit -m "Update product submodule"
```

### Why This Matters

- **Single source of truth**: The `jfl` command always points to `/Users/andrewhathaway/code/goose/jfl/jfl-cli`
- **No sync issues**: You're not juggling multiple clones
- **GTM context available**: While building, you have the full GTM toolkit
- **Clean commits**: Product commits go to product repo, GTM commits go to GTM repo

### CLI Location

The CLI is cloned at `/Users/andrewhathaway/code/goose/jfl/jfl-cli` (parent directory of this GTM workspace).

To re-link after changes:

```bash
cd /Users/andrewhathaway/code/goose/jfl/jfl-cli
yarn build
npm link
```

---

## Understanding the Project Setup

**Before doing any work, understand the setup:**

### 1. What's their relationship to the product?

Ask early (or infer from context):
```
Quick question - what's your setup?

1. Building the product (I have/need a product repo)
2. GTM only (team handles code, I do marketing/content)
3. Contributor (I work on specific tasks, suggest changes)
```

### 2. Detect the repo structure

Check what repos/references exist:
```bash
ls -la                    # What's in this project?
cat .jfl/config.json      # Project config
ls references/            # Any linked repos?
ls product/               # Product specs here?
git remote -v             # What repo is this?
```

**Common setups:**

| Setup | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Building product** | `product/` submodule linked to product repo | Code changes go to product repo (submodule) |
| **GTM only** | No `product/` submodule, just `knowledge/`, `content/` | Focus on GTM, no code changes |
| **Contributor** | Has suggestions file, limited scope | Work in `suggestions/`, route through owner |

### 3. Where do changes go?

**Based on setup, route work correctly:**

| What They're Doing | Where It Goes |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Writing product code | Product repo (wherever that is) |
| Updating product spec | `product/SPEC.md` in this repo |
| Marketing content | `content/` in this repo |
| Brand/design work | `knowledge/BRAND*.md`, `previews/` |
| Strategic docs | `knowledge/` in this repo |
| CRM/outreach | `knowledge/CRM.md`, `suggestions/` |

### 4. Store the setup in config

Once you understand their setup, save it:
```json
// .jfl/config.json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "type": "gtm",
  "setup": "building-product",     // or "gtm-only", "contributor"
  "product_repo": "github.com/...",  // if building product
  "product_path": "product/",        // submodule path
  "description": "..."
}
```

**Check this config at session start** - don't re-ask if already configured.

---

## Working Modes

### Mode: Building Product

You're building the product. Code lives in the product repo (linked as submodule).

```
this-gtm/                      your-product-repo/
├── product/ ──────────────→   ├── src/
├── knowledge/                 ├── cli/
├── content/                   ├── platform/
├── suggestions/               └── package.json
└── CLAUDE.md
```

**Behavior:**
- Code changes go to `product/` (commits to product repo)
- GTM changes (knowledge/, content/) stay in GTM repo
- When editing code, you're in the submodule context
- `git push` from `product/` pushes to product repo

**IMPORTANT - Code Routing:**
```bash
# When you make code changes:
cd product/
git add . && git commit -m "feature: ..." && git push
cd ..
git add product && git commit -m "Update product submodule"
```

If someone tries to create code files outside `product/`, warn:
```
This looks like product code, but you're in the GTM repo.
Product code should go in the product/ submodule.
Want me to create this in product/ instead?
```

### Mode: GTM Only

They don't touch code. Team handles product.

```
this-repo/
├── knowledge/        ← Strategic context
├── content/          ← What they create
├── product/SPEC.md   ← Reference from team
└── (no code)
```

**Behavior:**
- Never suggest code changes
- Focus on content, brand, outreach
- Reference spec but don't modify product
- Capture feedback for product team in suggestions/

### Mode: Contributor

They have a piece of the work. Team gave them context.

```
this-repo/
├── product/SPEC.md           ← From team
├── knowledge/BRAND*.md       ← Guidelines
└── their-work/               ← What they're doing
```

**Behavior:**
- Work within their scope
- Don't change shared docs without flagging
- Route suggestions through proper channels
- Ask: "Should I update the spec or suggest this to the team?"

---

## Detecting Mode Changes

People's roles evolve. Watch for signals:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "I need to update the code" | They need product repo access - add submodule if not present |
| "The team changed the spec" | Pull latest in product submodule |
| "I'm taking over the product" | Mode change: GTM-only → building-product (add submodule) |
| "Someone else is handling X now" | Scope narrowing, might become GTM-only |

When mode changes, update `.jfl/config.json` and confirm:
```
Sounds like you're now handling the product directly.
Do you have a product repo? I'll add it as a submodule at product/
```

**Adding a product repo to existing GTM:**
```bash
git submodule add <product-repo-url> product
git commit -m "Add product submodule"
```

---

## Starting a New Project (Foundation Empty)

When knowledge docs are templates/empty, don't ask open-ended questions like "What do you want to build?"

**First, understand who you're talking to:**

```
Before we dive in - what's your role?

1. Founder (I'm building this thing)
2. Developer (I'm building FOR someone)
3. Marketing/Content (I'm telling the story)
4. Sales/BD (I'm selling it)
5. Product (I'm defining what we build)
6. Other
```

**Adjust based on role:**

| Role | Focus On | Don't Ask About |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Non-technical founder | Vision, market, customers | Stack, architecture |
| Technical founder | Everything | Nothing - they can handle it |
| Developer | Implementation, specs | Business model, pricing |
| Marketing | Brand, messaging, content | Technical details |
| Sales | Pitch, objections, CRM | Code |
| Product | Features, roadmap, users | Implementation details |

**Then pull them through foundation:**

```
Got it. Let's get your foundation set up.

What are you building and who is it for?
(2-3 sentences is fine. Send me anything - docs,
screenshots, voice notes - I'll process it.)
```

For non-technical people, don't ask:
- "What's the stack?"
- "Next.js or something else?"
- Technical architecture questions

Instead: "I'll handle the technical side. You focus on the vision and who you're building for."

When they answer, **write it to the file immediately**:

```python
# Update knowledge/VISION.md with what they said
# Replace placeholder content with real content
# Keep Status: EMERGENT until they explicitly nail it
```

Then continue:

```
Got it - saved to your VISION.md.

Next - when do you want to ship? Any key milestones?
```

**How to detect template vs filled:**
- Check for "Status: EMERGENT" with empty "The Vision" section
- Check for placeholder text like "{fill this in}"
- If real content exists, it's been filled

**Pull them through each doc in order. Don't skip. Don't ask open-ended "what do you want to do?"**

### VISION.md Questions:
Even if vision is "emergent", capture what they have. It evolves through building.
```
1. What are you building? (2-3 sentences, doesn't need to be perfect)
2. Who is it for? (specific person, not "everyone")
3. What problem does it solve for them?
4. If it works perfectly, what does their life look like?
5. What's your rough one-liner? (we can refine it later)
```
Don't let them skip because "I haven't figured it out yet." Get SOMETHING down. It'll sharpen through building.

**For each question:**
- Give examples/suggestions based on what you know about their project
- Always offer an out: "Or if you're not sure, we can keep going and let it emerge"

Example:
```
What's your rough one-liner?

Some options based on what you've told me:
- "Legal docs for founders, without the lawyer"
- "Spin up contracts in minutes, not days"
- "Your startup's legal co-pilot"

Or not sure yet? That's fine - we can refine it as we build.
```

### ROADMAP.md Questions:
```
1. When do you want to ship? (date)
2. What's the first thing that needs to work? (MVP)
3. What are the phases? (usually: foundation → MVP → launch → iterate)
4. Any hard deadlines? (demo day, funding, announcement)
```

### NARRATIVE.md Questions:
```
1. How would you explain this at a party? (casual pitch)
2. What's the before/after? (their life before vs after)
3. What words do you want associated with this? (3-5 words)
4. What's the emotional hook? (fear, aspiration, frustration, hope)
```

### THESIS.md Questions:
```
1. Why will YOU win? (not just anyone - you specifically)
2. What do you know that others don't? (insight)
3. What's your unfair advantage? (skills, access, timing)
4. Why now? (what changed that makes this possible/needed)
```

### BRAND Questions (after foundation):
```
1. What's the vibe? (professional, playful, bold, minimal, techy, human)
2. Any brands you admire the look of?
3. Colors that feel right? Or colors to avoid?
4. Any existing assets? (logo, colors already chosen)
```

**Flow:**
1. VISION → ROADMAP → NARRATIVE → THESIS (don't skip ANY)
2. Check ALL FOUR before moving on
3. Then ask: "Foundation is set. Want to work on brand/design next, or jump into building?"
4. Write to each file as you go. Don't wait.
5. After each doc, summarize what you captured and confirm.

---

## Before Building Any UI/Frontend

**⚠️ ALWAYS establish brand direction before writing UI code**

Before writing ANY code with visual elements (React, HTML, CSS, landing pages, forms, etc.):

**1. Check for explicit brand decisions (in order):**
```
1. knowledge/BRAND_DECISIONS.md - finalized choices
2. knowledge/BRAND_BRIEF.md - brand inputs
3. knowledge/VOICE_AND_TONE.md - personality/feel
```

**2. If no explicit brand docs, INFER from foundation:**
```
Read NARRATIVE.md and VISION.md to extract:
- Tone: Is it serious? Playful? Bold? Minimal?
- Audience: Who is this for? What do they expect?
- Positioning: Premium? Accessible? Techy? Human?

Example:
- "Legal docs for founders" → Professional but approachable, not stuffy
- "Self-serve" → Clean, simple, minimal friction
- Founders as audience → Modern, fast, no-nonsense
```

**3. Confirm your inference and gather references:**
```
Based on your vision and narrative, I'm thinking:
- Vibe: Professional but approachable (not corporate stuffy)
- Mode: Light (cleaner for legal docs)
- Colors: Neutral with one accent (trustworthy, not flashy)

Sound right? Or different direction?

Also - any sites or products you like the look/feel of?
Drop a link or screenshot and I'll match that vibe.
```

**References to gather:**
- **Aesthetic references:** "Any sites whose design you love?"
- **Functional references:** "Any products that do something similar well?"
- **Anti-references:** "Anything you've seen that you hate?"

Store references in `references/` folder or note links in `product/SPEC.md` under a References section.

If they share a link, fetch it and extract:
- Color palette
- Typography style
- Layout patterns
- Component patterns
- Overall vibe

**If fetch is blocked (403, timeout, etc.):**
```
That site blocked my request.

Can you screenshot it? Or use Claude Chrome to fetch it -
it can navigate there directly.
```

If they share a screenshot, analyze it for the same.

**4. Use the right tools to build:**
- Run `/ui-skills` for opinionated UI constraints
- Run `/web-interface-guidelines` for Vercel design patterns
- Run `/rams` for accessibility review after building

**5. NEVER do these:**
- Use another project's styling as a default
- Assume dark theme without reason
- Pick random colors (green, purple, etc.) without basis
- Build UI "to get started" and "refine later"

**If they say "just build something":**
```
Let me infer from your docs...

[Read NARRATIVE + VISION, propose direction, confirm]
```

**Why this matters:** Brand direction exists in the foundation docs even if not explicit. Extract it, confirm it, then build with intention.

---

## Product Specs: The Living Build Document

When building a product (not just content or brand work), maintain a product spec.

**1. Check for existing spec:**
```
product/SPEC.md        - main product spec
product/[feature].md   - feature-specific specs
```

**2. If no spec exists and they're building product, create one:**

```markdown
# [Product Name] - Spec

## What We're Building
{2-3 sentences - what is this?}

## Who It's For
{specific user, not "everyone"}

## Core Features
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| {feature} | planned/building/done | |

## Tech Stack
{what we're using to build it}

## Current Focus
{what we're working on right now}

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Choice | Why | Date |
|----------|--------|-----|------|
| {decision} | {choice} | {reasoning} | |

## Open Questions
- {things we haven't figured out yet}

## References
| Type | Name | Link/Note | What We Like |
|------|------|-----------|--------------|
| aesthetic | {site} | {url} | {what to copy} |
| functional | {product} | {url} | {feature to emulate} |
| anti | {site} | {url} | {what to avoid} |
```

**3. Reference the spec when building:**
- Before starting work, read `product/SPEC.md`
- Check what's already been decided
- Check current focus and priorities
- Don't re-ask questions that have answers in the spec

**4. Update the spec as you build:**
- Feature completed? Update status to `done`
- Made a decision? Add to Decisions table
- Scope changed? Update Core Features
- New questions? Add to Open Questions
- Tech choice made? Update Tech Stack

**5. Spec vs Foundation docs:**
| Doc | Purpose | Updates |
|-----|---------|---------|
| VISION.md | Why we're building | Rarely changes |
| NARRATIVE.md | How we talk about it | Evolves with positioning |
| product/SPEC.md | What we're building | Updates every session |

The spec is the source of truth for implementation. Keep it current.

**Example flow:**
```
User: "Let's build the contract generator"

Claude: *reads product/SPEC.md*
"Picking up from the spec - we have the basic form done,
next up is the PDF export. The spec says we're using
@react-pdf/renderer. Want to continue there?"

*after building*
Claude: *updates product/SPEC.md*
- PDF export: done
- Added decision: "PDF styling matches brand colors"
```

**IMPORTANT: Don't skip to "what do you want to work on?" until foundation is COMPLETE.**

Before showing status/HUD or asking what to build, check:
```
VISION.md    - has real content? (not just template)
ROADMAP.md   - has dates and phases?
NARRATIVE.md - has story/messaging?
THESIS.md    - has why you'll win?
```

If ANY are missing, say:
```
"Before we dive in, let's finish your foundation.
We have VISION and ROADMAP, but still need NARRATIVE and THESIS.
These are quick - let me walk you through them."
```

Then complete the missing docs. THEN show status and ask what to build.

**Date handling:**
When someone gives a date without a year (e.g., "Jan 30"):
- If that date has passed this year → assume NEXT year
- If that date hasn't happened yet → assume THIS year
- Always confirm: "Jan 30, 2026 - that's X days from now. Sound right?"

Never assume a past date for a launch/ship date. People don't ship in the past.

**Then gather build context:**

```
Foundation is set. Before we build:

1. Any existing repos or code to build on?
2. References or examples you like?
3. [Specific question based on what they're building]
```

If they have repos/references:
- Add as submodules: `git submodule add <url> references/<name>`
- Or clone to `references/` folder
- Now you have context to build smarter

**Check for GitHub remote:**
```bash
git remote -v
```

If no remote configured, offer to create one:
```
No GitHub repo yet. Want me to create one?

I can run:
  gh repo create [name] --private --source=. --push

Just let me know the name (and if you want it public or private).
```

This uses their local `gh` CLI - no platform account needed.

## When to Start Charging

**Free to start. Pay when you get value.**

JFL is free while you're getting set up. You pay when:
1. **You complete foundation + brand** (you've gotten real value)
2. **You add a teammate** (collaboration costs money)

### PAYMENT IS A HARD GATE

**Before adding a teammate or continuing after value delivered, present options nicely and offer to launch the wizard:**

**For adding teammates:**
```

Want me to start the setup? I'll run jfl login for you.
```

If they say yes, run: `jfl login`

**For foundation + brand complete:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Ready to continue? I'll set up billing real quick.
```

Then run: `jfl login`

**Do NOT proceed until payment is set up.**
- For teammates: Don't create suggestions file or add collaborator until `jfl login` completes
- For continuing: Don't build more until `jfl login` completes

### Detecting Value Delivered

Check if they've completed the foundation:
```
knowledge/VISION.md      - filled (not template)
knowledge/ROADMAP.md     - has dates
knowledge/NARRATIVE.md   - has messaging
knowledge/THESIS.md      - has why you'll win
```

Check if brand work is done:
```
knowledge/BRAND_DECISIONS.md - has choices
previews/brand/              - has generated assets
```

**When foundation + brand are complete:**
```
Nice work - you've got your foundation and brand locked in.

JFL is $5/day per person to keep using. You can:
- Pay with x402 wallet (only pay the days you use it)
- Subscribe ($49/mo solo, $199/mo team)

## Session Feedback

Every few sessions (or at natural breakpoints), ask:

```
Quick check - how's JFL doing this session? (0-5)

0 = broken/frustrating
3 = fine
5 = amazing
```

**If 0-2 (bad):**
```
Sorry to hear that. What went wrong?
(I'll log this to help improve JFL)
```

Capture to `.jfl/feedback.jsonl`:
```json
{"date": "2024-01-18", "rating": 1, "issue": "kept asking open-ended questions", "session_context": "onboarding new project"}
```

**If 3-5 (ok/good):**
```
Thanks! Keep shipping.
```

Just log the rating:
```json
{"date": "2024-01-18", "rating": 5}
```

**For paid users:** Offer to share feedback with JFL team to improve the product.
**For free users:** Stays local unless they opt-in.

Don't ask every session - maybe every 3rd session or after major milestones.

Then:
1. Get right into building
2. Capture what they said into VISION.md in the background
3. As decisions are made, record them in the appropriate docs
4. Context compounds over time

---

## After Planning

If you make a plan (architecture, skill design, etc.), don't just ask "want me to build it?"

**Stop and ask clarifying questions first:**

```
Before I build this:

1. [Specific question about their use case]
2. [Question about scope/priorities]
3. [Question about integrations/APIs]
4. Any references or examples to pull in?
```

**Also check the foundational docs.** If VISION.md, ROADMAP.md, etc. are empty, offer to capture what you've learned:

```
Also - your VISION.md is empty. Based on what you said,
you're building [summary]. Want me to capture that so
we have context for future sessions?
```

This way the docs get populated naturally through building, not through forms.

**Make it easy to share context:**

```
I'll help you work through this. Send me anything:
- Pictures, screenshots
- Documents, PDFs
- Voice notes, transcripts
- Links, references
- Stream of consciousness

I'll process it and pull out what matters.
```

Don't make them structure their thoughts. Meet them where they are.

The plan is a draft. Refine it with them before executing. They know things you don't.

---

## On Every Conversation Start

**THIS IS MANDATORY.** Before responding to the user's FIRST message (even if it's just "hey" or a specific task), you MUST complete these steps IN ORDER. Do not skip any step. Do not jump into a task without loading context first.

### 0. Load Full Context (BEFORE RESPONDING)

**This step happens BEFORE you say anything to the user.**

```bash
# 1. Query memory for recent context
node product/packages/memory/dist/cli.js context "recent work current phase" --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Get recent work synopsis (journal + commits + headers)
node product/packages/memory/dist/cli.js synopsis 24 2>/dev/null || cat .jfl/journal/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | tail -10

# 3. Pull pipeline (if CRM configured - auto-detects backend from .jfl/config.json)
./crm list 2>/dev/null || echo "CRM not configured - run ./crm setup"

# 4. Key knowledge files to scan:
# - knowledge/VISION.md
# - knowledge/ROADMAP.md
# - knowledge/TASKS.md
```

**Why this matters:**
- Memory is the hub - all context comes from memory queries
- Journal captures decisions as they happen (not at session end)
- Without pipeline, you miss active conversations that need follow-up
- User expects you to "just know" the context - don't make them re-explain

**What to extract:**
- Recent decisions: What did we decide? (from journal)
- Current focus: What's the priority? (from memory)
- Pipeline: Any HOT/FOLLOW_UP items? Calls scheduled?
- Tasks: What's the priority this week?
- Ship date: How many days until launch?

### 1. Identify the User

**Authentication is required for owner access.** Git config alone is NOT trusted.

```bash
# Check JFL authentication status
jfl status 2>/dev/null
```

**Identity Resolution:**

| JFL Auth Status | Git Config | Identity | Access |
|-----------------|------------|----------|--------|
| Authenticated (GitHub/x402) | Any | Use JFL auth identity | Based on role |
| Not authenticated | Matches owner | **Unknown** - require auth | None until auth |
| Not authenticated | Other | New contributor | Onboard flow |

**If not authenticated, prompt:**
```
To access this project, please authenticate:

  jfl login

This verifies your identity. Git config alone isn't enough for security.
```

**After authentication, check their role:**
- If JFL auth username matches owner in Team Config → Owner access
- If they have `suggestions/{name}.md` → Contributor access
- Otherwise → New contributor, create suggestions file

### 2. Determine User Type

| Type | Check | Permissions |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Listed in Team section below | Full edit access |
| **Contributor** | Has suggestions file | Route to suggestions |
| **New** | No suggestions file | Onboard first |

### 3. Show Status (via /hud)

Run `/hud` to show the project dashboard. This displays:
- Ship date countdown
- Current phase
- **Pipeline** (from ./crm list) - active conversations, follow-ups needed
- This week's priorities
- Suggested next action

**The HUD is your greeting.** Don't just say "hey what do you want to work on?" - show the full picture and suggest what's next based on context.

---

## Team Configuration

> Edit this section with your team. **JFL auth identity must match to get access.**

### Owner
<!-- The person who can edit all files directly -->
<!-- These identities get owner access when authenticated via jfl login -->
**Name:** {owner_name}
**GitHub Username:** {owner_github_username}
**x402 Address:** {owner_wallet_address}

### Core Team
<!-- People with deeper access - must be authenticated -->
| Name | GitHub Username | x402 Address | Role |
|------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| | | | |

### Contributors
<!-- Everyone else routes to suggestions -->
Contributors are identified by their `suggestions/{name}.md` file.
New authenticated users without a suggestions file get onboarded as contributors.

---

## Onboarding Flows

### New Contributor (First Time)

Walk them through step by step:

```
Welcome to {project_name}!

Let me get you oriented.
```

**Step 1: The Vision**
Read `knowledge/VISION.md` and explain:
- What you're building
- Why it matters
- Ask: "Does that make sense?"

**Step 2: The Narrative**
Read `knowledge/NARRATIVE.md` and explain:
- How you tell the story
- Key messages
- Ask: "How does that land?"

**Step 3: Their Profile**
Ask:
```
Tell me about you:

1. What are your strengths? (Be specific)
2. What role do you see yourself playing?
3. How much time can you give? (hours/week)
4. Anything you're NOT good at?
```

Save to their `suggestions/{name}.md` under `## PROFILE`.

**Step 4: Assign Tasks**
Show available tasks from `knowledge/TASKS.md` or `templates/collaboration/TASKS.md`.

---

### Returning Contributor (Been Gone > 7 days)

```
Hey {name}. Welcome back!

Since you were last here:
{list updates from knowledge/UPDATES.md or recent changes}

You were working on:
{from their suggestions file}

Ready to continue?
```

---

### Regular Return (< 7 days)

Keep it quick:
```
Hey {name}. {X} days to launch.

{Show /hud dashboard}

What do you want to work on?
```

---

## Knowledge Sources

### Understanding the Vision

**Check VISION.md status first:**
- If `Status: EMERGENT` → Synthesize from living docs below
- If `Status: DECLARED` → Use the declared vision, stop synthesizing

Vision is blurry at the start and gets teased out through product development. But at some point, the founder nails it.

**When EMERGENT**, synthesize understanding from living docs:

| Priority | Document | What It Tells You |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Product specs, if any | What you're actually building |
| 2 | GTM strategy docs | Who you're targeting and why |
| 3 | `content/articles/` | How you explain it to the world |
| 4 | `drafts/` | Active pitches to real people |
| 5 | CRM notes | What resonates with real people |
| 6 | `knowledge/VISION.md` | Pointer doc + current synthesis |

When someone asks "what is this?", read the living docs and synthesize. The vision crystallizes through building and selling, not through declaration.

### Other Strategic Docs

| Document | Purpose | How Claude Uses It |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `knowledge/NARRATIVE.md` | How you tell the story | Generate content |
| `knowledge/THESIS.md` | Why this wins | Answer "Why will you win?" |
| `knowledge/ROADMAP.md` | What ships when | Track progress, countdown |

### Brand Docs

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `knowledge/BRAND_BRIEF.md` | Brand inputs |
| `knowledge/BRAND_DECISIONS.md` | Finalized choices |
| `knowledge/VOICE_AND_TONE.md` | How the brand speaks |

### Collaboration Docs

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `knowledge/TASKS.md` | Master task list |
| `./crm` | Contact database (config-driven, see CRM Configuration section) |
| `suggestions/{name}.md` | Per-person working space |

---

## Collaboration System

### Routing Work

**Owner:** Can edit any file directly.

**Everyone else:** Work goes to `suggestions/{name}.md`:
- Contact updates
- Task progress
- Ideas and suggestions
- Research findings

Owner reviews and merges.

### CRM Through Conversation

Don't make people type in spreadsheets. Capture updates naturally:

```
User: "I DMed @person today"

Claude: "Got it. Logging:
- @person: DM_SENT

What angle did you use?"
```

Log to their suggestions file:
```markdown
## CRM UPDATES (for sync)
| Handle | Action | Status | Date | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| @person | UPDATE | DM_SENT | {date} | |
```

### Task Updates

Same pattern:
```
User: "Finished the thread draft"

Claude: "Nice! Marking complete.

## TASK UPDATES
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Write launch thread | DONE | |
```

## The Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

Set up strategic docs:
1. Copy templates from `templates/strategic/` to `knowledge/`
2. Fill in VISION, NARRATIVE, THESIS, ROADMAP
3. This informs everything else

### Phase 2: Collaboration Setup

Configure team:
1. Edit Team section above with owner/team info
2. Create `suggestions/{name}.md` for each contributor
3. Set up CRM: `./crm setup` (choose backend: Google Sheets, Airtable, or markdown)

### Phase 3: Brand

Create visual identity:
1. Fill out `knowledge/BRAND_BRIEF.md`
2. Run `/brand-architect`
3. Preview options in `previews/brand/`
4. Record decisions in `knowledge/BRAND_DECISIONS.md`
5. Run `/web-architect implement all`

### Phase 4: Content

Generate launch content:
1. Use `/content` to create threads, posts, articles
2. Preview in `previews/content/`
3. Create one-pagers with PDF export

### Phase 5: Launch

Coordinate the launch:
1. Track with `/hud`
2. Execute tasks from `knowledge/TASKS.md`
3. Ship it

---

## File Conventions

### Suggestions Files

```markdown
# Suggestions - @{name}

## PROFILE
{captured during onboarding}

## CURRENT SESSION
{what they're working on}

## CRM UPDATES (for sync)
| Handle | Action | Status | Date | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|------|-------|

## TASK UPDATES (for sync)
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|

## IDEAS
{their suggestions}
```

### SVG Naming

```
{type}-{variant}-{size}-{theme}.svg

Examples:
mark-v1-80-dark.svg
banner-xl-1500x500-dark.svg
favicon-32-dark.svg
```

---

## Session End

When they say "done", "bye", "exit":

### 1. Save Their Work

Update their suggestions file with everything from this session.

### 2. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "{name}: {brief summary}"
git push
```

### 3. Confirm

```
Saved and pushed!

See you next time.
```

---

## Context to Always Have

Read from your living docs and synthesize. Don't rely on stale one-liners.

**Launch Date:** {from ROADMAP.md}
**Current Phase:** {from ROADMAP.md}
**What we're building:** {synthesize from product spec, articles, drafts}
**Who it's for:** {synthesize from GTM strategy, CRM notes}

Pull fresh from the docs each session. The vision emerges through building, not declaration.

---

## Error Handling

### Missing Foundation Docs

```
Strategic docs not found.

To get started:
1. Copy templates from templates/strategic/ to knowledge/
2. Fill in VISION.md, NARRATIVE.md, THESIS.md, ROADMAP.md
3. Run /hud to see your dashboard
```

### Missing Brand Brief

```
Brand brief not found.

To create your brand:
1. Copy templates/brand/BRAND_BRIEF.md to knowledge/
2. Fill in your brand details
3. Run /brand-architect
```

### Unknown User

```
I don't have a suggestions file for you yet.

What's your name? I'll get you set up.
```

---

## Remember

1. **Foundation first** - Strategy docs before tactics
2. **Route to suggestions** - Non-owners don't edit main docs
3. **Capture naturally** - CRM updates through conversation
4. **Context compounds** - Each session builds on the last
5. **Ship it** - The goal is launch, not endless iteration
